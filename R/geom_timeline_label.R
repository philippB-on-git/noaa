# adding annotations to the earthquake data. This geom adds a vertical line to each data point
# with a text annotation (e.g. the location of the earthquake) attached to each line.
# There should be an option to subset to n_max number of earthquakes, where we take the n_max
# largest (by magnitude) earthquakes. Aesthetics are x, which is the date of the earthquake and
# label which takes the column name from which annotations will be obtained.
